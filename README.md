Updated from milos code

Use src file i have there, most files have been moved around. it has 3 pages, a login page, a home page with the calendar, and an empty about-us page....

This patch has working event creating events with colours and has functionality for different popups to come up when you click an empty event and a filled calendar slot, editing an event does not work yet.

how do we store info on existing events?? Eg. descriptions

when clicking on an event it should have a popup which displays event name and description, from that we can have an edit button which would allow you to change the event name and color ect, also delete it
